Description: Plugin-driven server agent for collecting & reporting metrics
 Telegraf is an agent for collecting, processing, aggregating, and
 writing metrics.
 .
 Design goals are to have a minimal memory footprint with a plugin
 system so that developers in the community can easily add support for
 collecting metrics.
 .
 Telegraf is plugin-driven and has the concept of 4 distinct plugin
 types:
 .
  1. Input Plugins collect metrics from the system, services, or 3rd
     party API
 .
  2. Processor Plugins transform, decorate, and/or filter metrics
 .
  3. Aggregator Plugins create aggregate metrics (e.g. mean, min, max,
     quantiles, etc.)
 .
  4. Output Plugins write metrics to various destinations
